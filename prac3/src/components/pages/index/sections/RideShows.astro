  <p>
    Enjoy classic attractions like Pirates of the Caribbean, the Haunted
    Mansion, the Mad Tea Party’s whirling teacups and the Matterhorn Bobsleds
    ride, as well as experiences featuring new innovations, like the incredible
    special effects, freefall thrills, and multiple storylines of the Guardians
    of the Galaxy Mission: Breakout! adventure. Just outside the Breakout! ride,
    don’t be surprised when the music starts pumping and you can join either
    Team Starlord or Team Gamora in a dance-off.

    Fans of one particular galaxy far, far away will be transported by the Star
    Wars: Galaxy’s Edge land, where they can step into the world of Darth Vader
    and Luke Skywalker to live out their own Star Wars storyline, flying the
    Millennium Falcon and exploring a distant outpost. Marvel Comics fans won’t
    want to miss the Avengers Campus, the new land dedicated to discovering,
    recruiting, and training the next generation of super heroes. The attraction
    is also home to the Ancient Sanctum, where Dr. Strange emerges from an
    interdimensional portal to enlist the audience’s help in his otherworldly
    endeavors. Families with smaller kids should not miss Mickey’s Toontown,
    which offers interactive experiences, green spaces for free play, and the
    Mickey & Minnie’s Runaway Railway ride, which has no age or height
    restrictions.

    Fantasyland Theatre is another place where you’ll be transported, this time
    to the savannas of Africa via Tale of the Lion King. In this 30-minute
    theatrical adaptation of the classic Disney movie, you’ll follow Simba’s
    journey by way of narration, choreography, and song as he ascends to the
    throne.
